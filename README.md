# PayPal what is next?

## Overview and Origin

* PayPal Holdings, Inc.

* PayPal was originally established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek  in December 1998 as Confinity, a company that developed security software for hand-held devices. Having had no success with that business model, however, it switched its focus to a digital wallet. The first version of the PayPal electronic payments system was launched in 1999.
* In March 2000, Confinity merged with x.com, an online financial services company founded in March 1999 by Elon Musk, Harris Fricker, Christopher Payne, and Ed Ho.  Musk was optimistic about the future success of the money transfer business Confinity was developing. Musk and Bill Harris, then-president and CEO of X.com, disagreed about the potential future success of the money transfer business and Harris left the company in May 2000. In October of that year, Musk decided that X.com would terminate its other internet banking operations and focus on PayPal. That same month, Elon Musk was replaced by Peter Thiel as CEO of X.com, which was renamed PayPal in 2001 and went public in 2002. PayPal's IPO listed under the ticker PYPL at $13 per share and generated over $61 million.
* It became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay later that year, valued at $1.5 billion.In 2015 eBay spun off PayPal to its shareholders, and PayPal became an independent company again. [1] 
* The company was ranked 143rd on the 2022 Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.PayPal payments platform allows consumers to send and receive payments in approximately 200 markets and in approximately 100 currencies, withdraw funds to their bank accounts in 56 currencies, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies. [2]



## Business Activities:

* PayPal has become a major payment solution for online businesses and peer-to-peer transactions.

* Being the first in its domain gave the company a head start in the business. When PayPal was launched initially, hardly had people started using cellphones. But the companys decision to switch to a digital payment platform worked wonders for it, and the results can be seen even today. 
* PayPal benefitted from the pandemic, with more people required to shift their focus to online payment methods. 
* Huge profits mean that there is a steady cash flow within the company. It facilitates PayPal to try out new ideas and take some risks, as they would most certainly have some amount to fall back to in case the plan does not work out. The money can also be spent on advertisements in a bid to win over new consumers.
* PayPal has a reputation for hiring the best of the minds available in the domain. The technology used by the app is top-notch, with PayPal even lending its security protocols and ideas to the federal government at times. 
* The app uses 256-bit secure encryption for transactions. The company has managed to find the perfect balance between convenience and security, making it a popular choice among the customers. 
* PayPal had started as a cross-platform payments application. Later several other services such as credit and debit cards, card readers, etc. were launched. 
* Loans on a small scale are also offered by the company. All of these ensure that the company caters to a global and varied consumer base.
* Another advantage that PayPal enjoys over its competitors - application is available on both Google Play Store on Android and the iOS App Store. 
* This is not always the case with competitors such as Samsung Pay and Apple Pay that are restricted to certain platforms and operating systems. PayPal wide availability has been a major influence in making the company the worlds largest payment platform. [3]
* Shoppers who use PayPal have already created a wallet with all of their payment cards. What's more, banks are increasingly encouraging their customers to add their credit cards to PayPal, strengthening the competitive advantage PayPal's wallet provides.

## Landscape:

* PayPal represents the payment domain of the FinTech.
* One of the major trends in this domain in the last years became the inclusion. People who never before were a part of the formal financial system got the access to a transaction account to store money and send and receive payments. In developing countries, financial inclusion will continue to be driven by mobile devices and providing access to affordable, convenient payment mechanisms. 
* Another biggest trend is development of digital currencies. It is predicted that CBDCs along with private crypto currencies will have enormous disruptive impact over the next 20 years.
* Digital wallets allow consumers to load and store payment methods and access funding sources, such as cards or accounts, on their mobile devices. Soon they will be responsible for more than a half of the e-commerce payments worldwide.
* Outsourcing of cloud and platform infrastructure became increasingly important, too. Eight out of ten financial services expected to have outsourced cloud infrastructure.
* More often the cross-border payments are performed via instant and low-cost non-bank providers in order to avoid costly and cumbersome banking model.
* Last but not list Open banking, combined with a set of new players and the shift towards payment initiation and digital wallets, is opening new doors for all types of financial crime, such as the increased risk to consumers from authorized push payments (APP) scams across payment networks, globally. Payment providers that help merchants and their customers move money across borders might also enable sanctions evasion and money laundering. [5]

* Among the others working in this domain could be mentioned following companies and services: Stripe, TransferWise, Headnote, Flywire, Block, Payoneer, Google Pay Send, Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, QuickBooks Go Payment, Shopify payments.


## Results

* PayPal has evolved from an online checkout button to offering several financial services, both through in-house developments and acquisitions, ranging from digital wallets, to money transfers or even loans. The company has built a large network of consumers and merchants using its payment services.
* PayPal is a leading fintech company that benefits immensely from the secular growth trend in the digital payments industry.
* PayPal generated $25.3 billion revenue in 2021, an 18% increase year-on-year 
PayPal net profit declined slightly, from $4.2 billion in 2020 to $4.1 billion in 2021
Over 19 billion transactions were completed in 2021 on PayPal, accounting for $1.2 trillion in transaction volume. 
426 million users and merchants use PayPal [3]

* As up today, PayPal still have a very strong leading position in the online payments market, although the global payments industry is becoming highly competitive, being constantly changing. The leader should constantly remember about the risk of becoming just another one of many companies in the growing digital money space for payments systems.
* PayPal already lost the battle for the cost of transfers. PayPal will now charge more than Square (Block) or Stripe for online transactions, thus it will be important to see if PayPal's growth in total payment volumes and new active accounts continue to be strong or if growth rates will decline after this increase.
* According to Forbes, the favorite payment platform for merchants in 2022 was Square. That left PayPal on the 5th place with overall rating of 3.6 out of 5. [6]

* What is more, Square offers many of the same solutions as PayPal, but Square becomes more of a business solutions company. It offers payment solutions, but it also has back-end tools for running a business, like scheduling, payroll, marketing, loans, and more. A small business can literally be built on top of Square's platform.



## Recommendations

* I think, that the next natural step for the PayPal should become the development and further extension of its ecosystem, which would allow its clients to use the platform for all the needs that small business or merchant may have. These may include, for example, accounting and preparation of reports for tax purposes, cash flow forecasting or possibility to receive a crowd lending. The more solutions for the entirety of processes the platform could offer the less need the proprietor of small business would have to find fintech services outside its ecosystem. I think that would make PayPal a more attractive choice for new businesses and a stickier service provider for the long term.

For the realization of these ideas could be used following technologies:

* Integration of Digital Services - One dashboard that integrates with accounting packages and provides an overview of things like transactions, cash flow, outstanding invoices, tax return filings, and funding eligibility.

* Super Apps - omni-services within their through which, users can take out pet insurance, and travel insurance, buy commodities, and link to their other bank accounts and credit card statements through Open Banking.

* Open Finance - This provides the ability to aggregate user data from a range of financial apps in one place. Having all bank transaction, sales ledger, and credit bureau data in a single application means customers can get a real-time view of their cash position, capture any emerging risks to their business or identify working capital gaps before they become critical.

* Digital Working Capital - For too long, small businesses have relied upon bank overdrafts or personal credit cards to support their fluctuating working capital cycle. With the emergence of new lending technology, banks, specialist lenders, and fintechs are creating new frictionless finance products that use real-time data feeds to assess their eligibility for a wider range of lending products like term lending, invoice finance, and asset finance.

* Embedded Finance - The ability for financial service providers or specialist applications to embed their propositions into other third parties channels. This may mean that a small business can get access to a range of marketplace solutions in their banking app. [7]
